# RainfallRegime

This repository contains the reproducible code for the paper _Changes in Rainfall Regime: A Case Study in the Piracicaba River Basin, Brazil_ (Machado et al., 2026).

### Instructions

- The original daily data are stored in the `daily_data` folder.
- The `aux_data` folder contains additional (also original) data for the stations _esalq_ and _aic_ (Campinas).
- The main script is `rainfall_year.R`. It transforms the daily data into annual series, performs the statistical tests, and exports the resulting tables.
- After running `rainfall_year.R`, execute `rainfall_figures.R` to generate the figures presented in the paper.
